# A modified updated version of SmartBrain-api - v2
Final project for ZTM course <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/>
Original Repo: https://github.com/aneagoie/smart-brain-api

# Context:
A long time ago in 2020-2021, I was working on this. This was before AI tools. I had an error that I wasn't able to resolve and gave up on fixing this project. Came back after a long break to properly fix this. This is the updated repo.

# Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `controllers/image.js` file to connect to Clarifai API
5. Add your own database credentials to `server.js` line 12

You can grab Clarifai API key [here](https://www.clarifai.com/)

Note:
- Make sure you use postgreSQL instead of mySQL for this code base.
